Accordingly, the weekly newsletter and the retargetting ad campaigns are two campaigns which must be invested in to boost the business. Apart from that, the retargetting ad and the weekly newsletter are responsible for the most last touches. 

Furthermore, the "getting to know cool tshirts" is responsible for a significant portion of both the first and last touches. Therefore, it is a campaign worth investing in as it is attracting first-time clickers.

Similarly, the "interview with cool tshirts founder" and "ten crazy cool tshirts facts" campaigns are both attracting a large number of first touches and a decent number of last touches. Therefore, these 2 campaigns are worth reinvesting in.
